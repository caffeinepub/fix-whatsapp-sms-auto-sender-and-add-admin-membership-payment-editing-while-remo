  "summary": "The diff does not show any implemented change to the Reports > Member Financial Overview `moneyDue` calculation. Only type definitions are visible in the truncated `backend/main.mo`, and `project_state.json` was modified in a way not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Fix the admin Reports data so that, in Reports > Member Financial Overview, the returned `ReportMember.moneyDue` value represents the correct outstanding balance for each member (plan price minus sum of relevant payments; never negative; matches by current identifier approach; no traps; consistent with UI).",
      "reason": "The provided `backend/main.mo` diff excerpt contains type definitions but no visible changes to the report-building logic or any computation of `ReportMember.moneyDue` from membership plan price minus summed payments. Because the file content is truncated and no relevant logic is shown, there is insufficient evidence that the required calculation fix was implemented.",
