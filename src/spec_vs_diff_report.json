  "summary": "Frontend work adds a new CommunicationDisclaimer component and wires it into the admin CommunicationSimulation UI, but the diff does not provide clear evidence that the required backend member-creation onboarding payload (member + credentials + exactly 3 pending communication logs with required content, admin-only, uniqueness enforcement) was implemented. There are also unrelated additions/changes (e.g., project_state.json and changes in useInternetIdentity.ts) not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend support for admin-created members to return ManualCreateMemberResponse (member + credentials + communicationLogs) with exactly one log per channel (email/sms/whatsapp), English content including credentials + plan + payment/validity details, pending/failed (not delivered), admin-only authorization, and email uniqueness protection with no partial state.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is modified but the provided truncated diff does not show the required admin create-member method used by useCreateMemberWithManualCredentials, nor the construction/return of ManualCreateMemberResponse with exactly three communication log entries and required content/status/authorization/uniqueness behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated; no visible implementation of the required create-member onboarding response or authorization/uniqueness handling)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update MemberManagement success UI to render returned communicationLogs as simulated/not delivered, and ensure CommunicationSimulation status labeling does not imply real delivery while preserving copy-to-clipboard.",
      "reason": "Although CommunicationSimulation.tsx now imports and renders a disclaimer component and includes copy-to-clipboard logic, the diff is truncated before showing how log statuses are displayed and whether any label implies real delivery (e.g., 'Sent'). Also no concrete diff content is shown for MemberManagement.tsx even though the requirement explicitly targets that flow.",

        "frontend/src/components/admin/CommunicationSimulation.tsx (truncated; status display/labeling not shown)",

    {
      "description": "Added/updated project_state.json describing multiple pending feature requests (membership editing, payment editing, removing expense tracking, notification delivery fixes) beyond the scoped onboarding simulation/logging work.",
