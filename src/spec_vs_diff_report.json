  "summary": "Frontend adds a new MembershipPlanManagement component and wires it into the existing admin MemberManagement area, providing edit and delete actions (with dialogs and English UI text). However, there are no backend changes shown to ensure update/delete methods are exposed/admin-only as required, and React Query invalidation/refresh behavior is not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Ensure the backend canister interface exposed to the frontend includes membership plan update and delete methods (`updateMembershipPlan`, `deleteMembershipPlan`) and that both methods remain admin-only.",
      "reason": "No backend files (e.g., `backend/main.mo` or candid/interface generation) are modified in the diff summary, so there’s no evidence that the interface/admin-only enforcement was added or verified.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary shows only frontend changes: added `frontend/src/components/admin/MembershipPlanManagement.tsx`; modified `frontend/src/components/admin/MemberManagement.tsx`, `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`."

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "UI refreshes the membership plan list after updating/deleting via React Query invalidation.",
      "reason": "The new component calls `mutateAsync` and closes dialogs, but the diff summary does not show any query invalidation or refetch logic in the component, and `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` is not listed as modified, so refresh via invalidation is not evidenced.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/admin/MembershipPlanManagement.tsx (added): calls `updateMembershipPlan.mutateAsync(updatedPlan)` and `deleteMembershipPlan.mutateAsync(selectedPlan.id)` but no invalidation/refetch shown in provided excerpt.",
        "File diff summary does not list `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` as modified."

      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt: `frontend/src/components/admin/MemberManagement.tsx` summary mentions \"corrected prop usage for ProfilePictureModal (open/onOpenChange) and CommunicationSimulation (response).\""
